The models are trained on a dataset of 9985 pairs of SDO/HMI magnetograms and SDO/AIA UV/EUV images from 2011 to 2016. The data is preprocessed to ensure consistency and quality, including calibration, exposure normalization, and degradation correction. The models are evaluated on a test set from 2017 using metrics such as pixel-to-pixel correlation, relative error, and the percentage of pixels with errors less than 10%.

Furthermore, a CNN-based flare forecasting model trained with AR patches (resized to 100100 pixels) extracted from LoS magnetograms within 30∘ of the solar longitude to predict C-, M-, and X-class flares was presented in [13].',\n",
